Question 1
Consider influenza epidemics for two parent heterosexual families. 
Suppose that the probability is 17% that at least one of the parents has contracted the disease. 
The probability that the father has contracted influenza is 12% while the probability that both 
the mother and father have contracted the disease is 6%. What is the probability that the mother
has contracted influenza?
Ans-
This question is based on standard probability of a union of events. Let A∪B represent that at 
least one of the parents has contracted a disease. Let A represent that the father has contracted 
the disease and let A∩B represent that both parents have contracted the disease. Using probability axioms, 
we thus get:

P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)

We wish to solve for the probability of the mother getting the disease. Using the notation above and what 
is given in the question, we can thus deduce:

P(A)=0.12P(A∩B)=0.06P(A∪B)=0.17

Therefore, by straight substituting, we wish to solve for P(B) and thus:

0.17=0.12+P(B)−0.06P(B)=0.11

Question 2
A random variable, X is uniform, a box from 0 to 1 of height 1. (So that it's density is f(x)=1 for 
0≤x≤1.) What is it's 75th percentile?
Ans-
The PDF of the density is given as: P(x)=1,s.t. x∈[0,1]. The 75th percentile is defined as the point x w
here 75% of the area is on the left side while 25% is on the right side. Because the total area of this 
density is 1 and is a uniform box, we simply need to figure out at what x value would give us 0.75 for the 
CDF. In this case, it's simply 0.75.

Question 3-
You are playing a game with a friend where you flip a coin and if it comes up heads
you give her X dollars and if it comes up tails she gives you Y dollars. 
The probability that the coin is heads is p (some number between 0 and 1.) 
What has to be true about X and Y to make so that both of your expected total earnings is 0. 
(The game would then be called “fair”.)
Ans-
Let Z denote a random variable where Z=0 denotes the probability of getting X dollars by 
flipping a heads while Z=1 denotes the probability of losing Y when flipping a tails.
We wish to determine the expected payout given that the probability of flipping a heads is 
p while for tails it's 1−p. In other words:

P(Z=0)=pP(Z=1)=1−p

As such, the expected payout E[Z] is thus:

E[Z]=∑yyP[Z=y]

y is how much money we gain / lose when we flip a heads or tails. In other words, the expected value is such:

E[Z]=X(P(Z=0))−Y(P[Z=1])

To ensure a fair game, the expected payout should be 0 or E[Z]=0. Setting the above equation to 0, 
and substituting our probabilities, we thus get:

0=Xp−Y(1−p)

Rearranging this equation thus gives:

YX=p1−p

##
Question 4
A density that looks like a normal density (but may or may not be exactly normal) is exactly
symmetric about zero. (Symmetric means if you flip it around zero it looks the same.) What is its median?
Ans-
 If the density is symmetric about zero (and even if it doesn't touch the horizontal axis), what this 
 means is that the centre of the distribution is at 0 while the left and right tails will have the
 same area. Because of the fact that the density is symmetric about zero, this implies that right 
 at the middle of the total area is where the horizontal axis would be 0. The median is defined as
 the point where it is the 50th percentile. Being right 
 in the middle of the total area is the same thing as being the median and so the answer is Yes, 
 the median must be 0.

 Question 5
 

Consider the following PMF generated in R

x <- 1:4
p <- x/sum(x)
temp <- rbind(x, p)
rownames(temp) <- c("X", "Prob")
temp

##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
## X     1.0  2.0  3.0  4.0
## Prob  0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4

What is the mean?

Ans-
sum(temp[1, ] * temp[2, ])

## [1] 3

The above code finds the product of each term in the density X followed by their associated 
probabilities. We will have a 4 element vector which contains these products. The mean is 
simply adding all of these products together, and hence why we are invoking sum.

Question 6
A web site (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/band64/b64-7.html) for home pregnancy tests cites the following: “When the subjects using the test were women who collected and tested their own samples, the overall sensitivity was 75%. Specificity was also low, in the range 52% to 75%.” Assume the lower value for the specificity. Suppose a subject has a positive test and that 30% of women taking pregnancy tests are actually pregnant. What number is closest to the probability of pregnancy given the positive test? Express your answer to the nearest percentage point.
Ans-
round((0.75 * 0.3)/((0.75 * 0.3) + ((1 - 0.52) * (1 - 0.3))) * 100)

Question 7

A web site (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/band64/b64-7.html) for home pregnancy tests
cites the following: “When the subjects using the test were women who collected and
tested their own samples, the overall sensitivity was 75%. Specificity was also low,
in the range 52% to 75%.” Assume the lower value for the specificity. Suppose a 
subject has a positive test and that 30% of women taking pregnancy tests are actually pregnant.
What number is closest to the probability of pregnancy given the positive test?
Ans-
Let F = player makes the first shot F¯¯¯ = player does not make the first shot S = player
makes the second shot You are given: P(F∪S)=0.9 since at least one shot means they got First 
shot OR Second short or both (and there are only 2 shots in total) P(F)=0.8 P(S)=0.8 P(F∩S)=0.7 
You are asked: to find P(S|F¯¯¯)
P(S|F¯¯¯)=P(S∩F¯¯¯)P(F¯¯¯)
Notice that P(S)=P(S∩F)+P(S∩F¯¯¯)⟹P(S∩F¯¯¯)=P(S)−P(S∩F)=0.8−0.7=0.1 And P(F¯¯¯)=1−P(F)=1−0.8=0.2 So:
P(S|F¯¯¯)=P(S∩F¯¯¯)P(F¯¯¯)=0.10.2=0.5=50%
